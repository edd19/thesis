Netflow developed by cisco. Many system administrators will be familiar with system monitoring tools such as net-mgmt/nagios, net-mgmt/collectd5, net-mgmt/cacti or net/vnstat. Whilst these tools can monitor and record network traffic statistics, they do not record details of source and destination IP addresses or TCP/UDP port numbers for the network traffic. Without this information, troubleshooting a spike in network traffic is left to reviewing log files or asking "what happened at that point in time?".

This is where NetFlow can help. Originally introduced by Cisco, it allows source/destination network traffic statistics ("flow records") to be stored and analysed. The NetFlow Wikipedia article provides further information about NetFlow.
