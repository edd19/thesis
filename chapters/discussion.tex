\chapter{Other Possible Solutions}

After having explained the architecture of our monitoring tool and the technologies we have used to implement it, we have also introduced Nfsen along with Nfdump, that was supposed to be the first technology that we were going to use to develop our solution.\\

In this section, we will discuss other possible technologies that could have been used in the place of those that are part of our solution.

TinyOS, RIOT ?

\chapter{Possible Extensions}


Data traffic for a specific node, added on a panel, more specific data information for links in the network (with the help of opacity ?), data information for applications in the IoT Network (for now, no application layer?), security (crypted packet, authentication, ...?)
